Transmit Punctuation allows for exactly that, punctuation in transmits! For some reason, any and all punctuation gets removed when a transmit is made. The function that removes that punctuation is also only ever used for transmissions, so I don't quite know why it is even a thing. All this mod really does technically is stop the function from calling and just returning the parameter... nothing major...
